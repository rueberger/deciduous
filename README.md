Note: andberger is my previous account. This project is not likely to see future development but there's some hope of building a new machine learning driven chess engine soon :D

======================

deciduous is my pet chess engine 

Its board representation is bitboard based 

The search will consist of the usual bag of tree pruning and memoization tricks

The evaluation is where all of the fun will happen  

It is under active development (when I'm not swamped with school and research) which is to say occasionally I break it out and do some work. Probably by 2016ish it will work
